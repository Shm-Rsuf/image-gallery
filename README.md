## Objective:
This repository aims to showcase a well-designed and responsive image gallery application built with React JS. The primary objectives are to implement features for reordering images, deleting multiple images, and setting a featured image. The project's focus is on delivering a visually appealing user interface and ensuring a seamless user experience, making it a valuable resource for those looking to create similar functionality in their React applications.

## Features:
1. **Gallery Layout:**
   - I have implemented a grid layout for our image gallery.
   - where the images are displayed, with one of them featured and displayed larger than the others.
2. **Sorting:**
   - Enabled reordering functionality to allow users to rearrange the order of images in the gallery.
   - Implemented drag-and-drop functionality, creating an intuitive method for reordering the images.
3. **Deleting Multiple Images:**
   - Allowed users to select multiple images and delete them.
   - Provided a clear visual indication of the selected images, ensuring a straightforward and user-friendly process for deletion.
4. **Setting Feature Image:**

  - The feature image has been made visually distinct from the other images, enhancing its prominence in the gallery.
